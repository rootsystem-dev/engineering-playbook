Mapping the Escape key to the Caps Lock key on macOS is indeed possible. You can use theKeyboard Viewer, a system utility that allows you to inspect and modify keyboard layouts and mappings.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Open Keyboard Viewer**:
   - Press `Option-Shift-K` to open Keyboard Viewer.

2. **Configure Key Mappings**:
   - In the Keyboard Viewer window, you will see a graphical representation of your keyboard. Click on "Document" and then select "Show viewer" to activate Keyboard Viewer.

3. **Create a New Custom Keyboard**:
   - Click on the "Edit" menu and select "Add a new mapping" from the dropdown menu.
   - This will open a new window where you can create a custom keyboard layout.

4. **Map Escape to Caps Lock**:
   - Click on the "Layouts" button at the top of the window and select "Text" to create a new entry.
   - In the "Modifier Keys" section, click on the option called "Escape" and change it to "Caps Lock."

5. **Save Your Changes**:
   - Once you've made the change, go to the menu at the top and click on "File" > "Save" to save your changes.

6. **Apply the Custom Layout**:
   - Your custom layout will be applied immediately. You can test it by pressing Caps Lock to simulate an Escape key press.

This approach allows you to modify how keyboard keys behave without needing third-party software or complicated setup processes.
